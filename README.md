# Dulus Business Manager (DBM)

The Dulus Business Manager (DBM) is a comprehensive web application built using Next.js 14, React 18, and Firebase, designed to streamline business operations for small to medium-sized enterprises. The application features a modern, responsive dashboard with real-time data synchronization through Firebase integration. Key components include a smart AI chatbot assistant ("Sparky") that helps users with business queries and task management, a client management system for tracking customer information and interactions, an invoicing module for creating and managing invoices, and a comprehensive reporting system for business insights. The UI is built using Radix UI components styled with Tailwind CSS, featuring a clean, accessible interface with dark/light mode support. Core functionalities include real-time sales charts for performance visualization, task management with priority settings and deadlines, a recent activity feed showing latest business operations, and statistical cards displaying key metrics. The application implements secure authentication through Firebase, protecting sensitive business data while allowing seamless user management. Advanced features include business insights generation through AI integration, daily activity summarization, and text-to-speech capabilities for accessibility. The app's architecture follows a modular pattern with separate components for layout (header, sidebar), business logic (hooks, contexts), and UI elements (forms, dialogs, tables). Notable technical implementations include TypeScript for type safety, error boundaries for robust error handling, responsive design for mobile compatibility, and optimized data fetching through Next.js server components. The application also includes privacy and terms pages, user settings management, and a support section for user assistance.
